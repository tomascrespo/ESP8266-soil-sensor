## Professional soil moisture sensor based on ESP8266 

Ann industrial grade soil sensor to get moisture and temperature at two deep levels using two ComWin Top professional soil sensors and a ESP8266 development board (Wemos D1 mini Pro v2) battery powered with a solar panel support. The code reads the sensor values and publish them to a MQTT broker.
